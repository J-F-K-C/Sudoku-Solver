Simple Soduko Solver


This is my simple Sudoku Solver. It's not quiet good actually and needs some love.
At the moment you have to give all known numbers manually and leave the others as 0 to let the programm solve your riddle.
I mostly did it to try some algorythms.

-----
Future Tasks:
* Better Command Line Based GUI
* Maybe some other ways to load Sudokus into the Programm (Like Data Import or OCR mechanic)
